# ðŸ§¾ Document Classifier (PyTorch CNN)

This project is a lightweight image classification system built with PyTorch. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify grayscale images as either:

- `ID` (e.g. identification cards)
- `RECEIPT` (e.g. shopping or payment receipts)

The model was trained on a custom dataset of scanned or photographed document images.
